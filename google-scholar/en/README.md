# Google Scholar Indexing guide

This guide provides guidance around the indexing of Open Journal Systems (OJS) that can also be used for Open Monograph Press (OMP) in Google Scholar. It is written largely for an audience of journal managers as well as systems administrators - those who are responsible for the installation, upgrading and general maintenance of the system. We have tried to suggest the sections which are most applicable to these two audiences.
