# Bölüm 1: Giriş

Open Journal Systems \(OJS\), bilimsel dergileri çevrimiçi olarak yönetmek ve yayınlamak için açık kaynaklı bir çözümdür. OJS; ücretsiz olarak indirilebilen ve yerel bir Web sunucusuna kurulabilen, editör tarafından işletilen, oldukça esnek bir dergi yönetim ve yayıncılık sistemidir.

OJS, bir derginin düzenlenmesiyle ilgili yazım ve yönetim görevlerine ayrılan zaman ve enerjiyi azaltırken, kayıt tutma ve editoryal süreçlerin verimliliğini artırmak için tasarlanmıştır. Okuyucu deneyimini geliştirmek, dergi politikalarını daha şeffaf hale getirmek ve indekslemeyi geliştirmek de dahil olmak üzere bir dizi yenilik yoluyla dergi yayıncılığının bilimsel ve kamusal kalitesini iyileştirmeyi amaçlamaktadır.

Bu kitap, Ekim 2017'de yayınlanan OJS 3.1 sürümünü kapsar ve yazılımın önceki sürümlerine göre önemli geliştirmeler içerir. Bunu yayıncılık projeleriniz için yararlı bulacağınızı umuyoruz.

## Background

*OJS is a journal/web site management/publishing system*. OJS covers all aspects of online journal publishing, from establishing a journal website to operational tasks such as the author's submission process, peer review, editing, publication, archiving, and indexing of the journal. OJS also helps to manage the people aspects of organizing a journal, including keeping track of the work of editors, reviewers, and authors, notifying readers, and assisting with the correspondence.

*OJS is flexible and scalable*. A single installation of OJS can support the operation of one or many journals. Each journal has its own unique URL as well as its own look and feel. OJS can enable a single editor to manage all aspects of a journal and the journal's website, or OJS will support an international team of editors with diverse responsibilities for a journal's multiple sections.

*OJS supports the principle of extending access*. This system is intended not only to assist with journal publishing, but to demonstrate how the costs of journal publishing can be reduced to the point where providing readers with "open access" to the contents of the journal becomes a viable option. The case for open access is spelled out over a wide series of articles stemming from this project which are freely available under Research > Publications on the [Public Knowledge Project](https://pkp.sfu.ca/) website.

*The origins of OJS*. The system was first released in 2001 as a research and development initiative at the University of British Columbia, with the support of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Max Bell Foundation, the Pacific Press Endowment, and the MacArthur Foundation. Its continuing development is currently overseen by the Simon Fraser University Library. For more information, see the [Public Knowledge Project website](http://pkp.sfu.ca).

## What's New in OJS 3

OJS 3 is significantly different than its predecessor, OJS 2. It includes enhancements and new features developed from community feedback, extensive usability testing, and new software design capabilities.

## Reader Interface

By default, Open Journal Systems is installed with a very simple, functional user interface. This includes a top header, navigation bar, navigation blocks to the right, and a main content block in the middle of the page.

The following image is a screenshot of an OJS Demonstration Journal Table of Contents.

![Table of Contents for a sample OJS journal.](./assets/learning-ojs-3-ojs3-interface.png)

You can see from the screenshot that the user functions now exist from your profile menu at the top right of the screen. This takes the managerial content in OJS 3.x away from general user view. Side bar information is clearly broken out, as well as your top navigation bar with collapsible menus for the "About" functions. Like OJS 2, each article has a linked title for viewing object metadata and abstracts, and galleys are now clearly labeled below the titles with clearer logos.

## Editorial Interface

_AKA "The Dashboard"_

OJS 3.x now has a separate interface once you log into the editorial system. This not only makes it easier to customize the reader interface, but also provides OJS users of different journals a consistent experience.

![The main OJS dashboard](./assets/learning-ojs3.1-ed-dashboard.png)

The editorial interface is known as your **dashboard** and consists of the following elements:

1. **Top Navigation Bar**: To the left, you will find the name of the journal you are currently working with \(e.g., Journal of Public Knowledge\). If you are enrolled in more than one journal on this OJS installation, you can use this to switch between journals. Next to that are your Tasks \(items needing immediate attention\). To the right, you can switch languages if the journal is multilingual, view the reader interface, or click on your username to view [your profile](./viewing_and_changing_your_profile.md) or logout.
2. **Left Menu Panel**: These are the major sections of the dashboard, including the submissions, issue management, subscription management \(if you are running a journal using subscriptions\), settings, user and role management, and tools. Users with fewer permissions \(e.g., Authors, Reviewers, Copyeditors, etc.\) will see fewer links here.
3. **Blue Navigation Bar**: These menu choices are specific to the different sections of the editorial workflow. Metadata, Editorial History, and Submission Library are all part of the submission record visible below.
4. **Main Panel**: In the main panel you will see the current work area. In the image above, you are looking at a submission record in the Production stage.
5. **Main Panel Sub-Menus**: Within the Main Panel, you will often see tabs that allow you to view different information about the content being worked on. In this example, the submission record is broken into four sections \(Submission, Review, Copyediting, Production\). Notice the Help tab to the right, which provides context-sensitive help for the page you are currently viewing.
6. **Right Panel**: From here, you can see the action buttons, such as Schedule for Publication. Different pages have different action buttons. Below the action buttons is the Participants table, which lists everyone \(except Reviewers\) involved in the submission.
