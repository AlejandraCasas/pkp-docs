# Setting up and Maintaining Your Press

There are a number of components to your press found in the Settings menu on the left navigation bar. All of the site configuration options are under Settings > Press. The options you find here control every aspect of the press, including press information, how your press looks, workflow settings, and how the publication and distribution processes work. This section will go in-depth on your Press and Workflow Settings. Please refer to the [Learning OJS guide](https://docs.pkp.sfu.ca/learning-ojs/en/) for information regarding the Website and Distribution that will be applicable in your OMP installation.

## Press Settings

In the Press Settings section, you can configure information about your press that will be displayed for readers, such as your press name, editorial team, and contact information. You can also set up and configure series and categories, which are used to display and organize your published monographs.

You can find the Settings in the left menu panel when you are logged in as a user with Press Manager permissions. This section contains most of the information that you provided when originally creating your press (and which can be modified at any time).
