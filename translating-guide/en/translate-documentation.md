# Translate PKP Documentation

PKP uses a different tool for translating documentation called GitLocalize, which is compatible with markdown files, integrated with GitHub, and designed for translating longer pieces of text - and so better suited for translating documentation than Weblate. This chapter explains how to use GitLocalize, find documentation to translate, translate documentation, and maintain translations. 
You can translate documentation directly in GitHub without using GitLocalize and the section “Translate without GitLocalize” explains how to do that, but we still recommend reading this chapter to understand how documentation translation works as a whole.
